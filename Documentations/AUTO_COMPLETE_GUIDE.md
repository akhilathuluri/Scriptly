## Requirements

### API Key
- Google Gemini API key required
- Configure in Settings dialog
- Can use company key or personal key

### Minimum Text Length
- At least 20 characters needed
- Suggestions work best with complete sentences
- Context improves with more text

### Cursor Position
- Cursor must be at the end of text
- Suggestions don't appear mid-document
- Move cursor to end to see suggestions

---

## Performance

### Response Time
- **1.5 seconds** - Debounce delay before requesting
- **1-3 seconds** - AI processing time
- **Total: 2.5-4.5 seconds** - From stop typing to suggestion

### Optimization
- Suggestions are debounced to reduce API calls
- Previous requests are cancelled when typing
- Only processes when cursor is at end
- Minimum text length prevents unnecessary calls

## Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- Text sent to Google Gemini API for processing
- Only last 500 characters sent for context
- No data stored on our servers
- API key stored locally in browser

### Best Practices
- Don't use with confidential information
- Review suggestions before accepting
- Disable for sensitive documents
- Use personal API key for private work

4. Move cursor to end of text
5. Check internet connection

### Suggestions Not Relevant

**Possible Causes**:
- Insufficient context
- Ambiguous writing
- AI misunderstanding intent

**Solutions**:

- Dismiss and continue typing
- Rephrase your text

### Slow Performance

**Possible Causes**:
- Slow internet connection
- API rate limits
- High server load

**Solutions**:
- Check internet speed
- Wait a few moments
- Disable if too slow
- Try again later

### API Errors

**Error Messages**:
- "AI Assistant not initialized"
- "Failed to process AI request"
- "API key invalid"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key in Settings
2. Check API key is valid
3. Ensure API key has quota remaining
4. Try re-entering API key
